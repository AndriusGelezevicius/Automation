# Learning Python Automation  

## About  
I am learning Python automation to improve efficiency and simplify repetitive tasks. I am exploring libraries like `os`, `shutil`, and `selenium` for file management, web automation, and scripting.  

## Goals  
- Automate daily tasks
- Work with files and system operations using `os`, `Path` and `shutil`
- Learn data analysis and computation with `Pandas`, `NumPy`
- Learn web scraping with `BeautifulSoup` and `Selenium`  
- Write automation scripts for productivity  

## Progress  
I am currently practicing Python scripting and experimenting with automation projects.
